# JVF2010a-Floppy-Formatter
I created this project while trying to create images / animations to my JVF2010-A LED sign.

The current software to do this can be found from:
https://johniii.tripod.com/jvf.html \
but does not seem to work on my windows 10 pc. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO to fix it I decompiled and remade the provided 2010a.exe executable which formats a floppy to the sign's operating system to then load the provided animation files.
