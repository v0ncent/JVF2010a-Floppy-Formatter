# JVF2010a-Floppy-Formatter
I created this repo while trying to create images / animations to my JVF2010-A LED sign.

The current software to do this can be found from:
https://johniii.tripod.com/jvf.html \
The exe was not working on my pc so here are the exe contents decompiled so you can reimage your floppies another way
